        <p class="intro">Our research focuses on primary cilia, eyelash-like protrusions on the cell membrane. Like 'biological antennae', they receive information that is crucial to how cells develop. When cilia don't function it can lead to serious illnesses, called ciliopathies. Specifically we are looking into how cilia function in eye cells and how ciliopathy patients can be treated.</p>

      <h2>PhD position investigating the molecular basis of cilia and ciliopathies</h2>
      <p>Enthusiastic scientists with an interest in cilia biology, disease and translational medicine are invited to apply for a doctoral position in a newly established research group at the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz. The project will focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration caused by cilia dysfunction, the role of Wnt signaling in the retinal pigment epithelium, and the evaluation of emerging treatment paradigms. The laboratory, led by Dr Helen May-Simera, a Sofja Kovalevskaja Awardee, works in close collaboration with top experts in the field. Applicants should have a Masters with extensive training in molecular biology, cell biology, and experience working with mouse models. The position is immediately available.</p>
      <p>To apply, please send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, list of publications, contact information of three references and a personal statement describing research experience, current interests, and future goals to <a href="mailto:hmaysime@uni-mainz.de">hmaysime@uni-mainz.de</a></p>
